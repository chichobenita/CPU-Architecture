CPU Architecture LAB4 – FPGA-Based Digital Design

Overview

In Lab 4 we migrate the synchronous digital system from Lab 1 onto a Cyclone II FPGA, then evaluate its performance, area utilization and timing, and finally validate its functionality in hardware on the DE10-Standard board.

Key objectives:

Functional Simulation with maximal coverage (ModelSim)

FPGA Synthesis & Timing Analysis (Quartus II)

Performance Metrics: fₘₐₓ, logic usage, critical/shortest paths

Hardware Validation: I/O on DE10 (switches, keys, LEDs, 7‑segment)

Signal Tap Debug for internal signal capture
